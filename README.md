# jenkins-ctest-plugin + [xUnit-plugin](http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/xUnit+Plugin "xUnit Plugin") = CTest test reports in [Jenkins-CI](http://jenkins-ci.org/ "Extensible continuous integration server")

## Project Status

This was worthwhile and worked when I last used it.
However, I have moved on, no longer use this or know if it is valuable, and have no capacity to meaningfully maintain it.

**Unmaintained**

## Installation

1. Make sure you've installed the xUnit Plugin in Jenkins.
2. Get the [`ctest-to-junit.xsl`][xsl] file onto your Jenkins server(s) - I tend to use a Git Submodule to pull this whole repo into other projects.


## Using the Transform

1. When configuring your Job, in *Post-build Actions*, add *Publish xUnit test result report*, and add the *Custom Tool* option. (Actually, since [this bug from May 2013][jenkins-issue], it looks like my XSL file is integrated with the plugin!)
  - Specify the path to the [`ctest-to-junit.xsl`][xsl] stylesheet if you use Custom
2. Specify a pattern for CTest files to transform.
3. GO!

## Running the Tests
It takes a little finagling to get CTest to generate the XML output for consumption by this XSL.

### *nix
You might want to look at [`run-test-and-save.sh`][sh] to see one way of prompting CTest to generate XML output and then moving it. You can execute that script as a build step from your build directory, and then your "pattern" will be `BUILDDIR/CTestResults.xml`.

### Windows
If you're on Windows, you can use the PowerShell script (with batch file launcher): run [`run-test-and-save.bat`][bat] (which runs [`run-test-and-save.ps1`][ps1] for you) which will have the same results as the *nix shell script.

Note that if you're using a multi-config generator (for example, Visual Studio), you need to pass a configuration to this script (which will pass it on to CTest), something like `-C Debug`. To accommodate this, if you pass a config using `-C`, the config name will be prepended to the output XML filename, e.g. `Debug.CTestResults.xml`
